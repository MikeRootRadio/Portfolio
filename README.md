# Portfolio
I am a part owner of a carpet cleaning company. I wanted to be able to analyze our biometrics to get a feel for how 
my technicians were doing with additional services. As well as which cities or zipcodes seemed to make more money.
This Portfolio comtains tables I have created as well as stored procedures created with SQL in order to Extract,
Transform and Load the data I entered into a spreadsheet. This can be used for most any carpet cleaning company
as well as altered for use in other services industries.
