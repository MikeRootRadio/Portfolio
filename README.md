I also know how to use Microsoft Report Builder and PowerBI in order to visual business strategies in my previous business. 

I am a part owner of a carpet cleaning company. I wanted to be able to analyze our biometrics to get a feel for how 
my technicians were doing with the additional services we provide.

This Portfolio contains tables I have created as well as [stored procedures](https://github.com/Rwpulley/Portfolio/blob/main/CarpetCleaning/StoredProcedures/JobDetails_LoadExcelData.sql) created with SQL in order to Extract,
Transform and Load the data I entered into a spreadsheet. This can be used for most any carpet cleaning company as well as altered for use in other services industries.
