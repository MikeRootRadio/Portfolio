My name is Rhet Pulley. I am a part owner of a carpet cleaning company. I wanted to be able to analyze our biometrics to get a feel for how 
my technicians were doing with the additional services we provide.

As well as which cities or zipcodes seemed to make more money.

This Portfolio contains tables I have created as well as [stored procedures](https://github.com/Rwpulley/Portfolio/blob/main/CarpetCleaning/StoredProcedures/JobDetails_LoadExcelData.sql) created with SQL in order to Extract,
Transform and Load the data I entered into a spreadsheet. This can be used for most any carpet cleaning company as well as altered for use in other services industries.

I have been able to learn Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL and MySQL within the last year. However I prefer Microsoft SQL.
I know how to do: 

Common SQL data types and database normalization,
UNIONs, JOINs, subqueries, case statements,
Transactions, catching and handling errors, rolling back changes,
higher functions such as Common Table Expressions, Windows functions, PIVOTs,
stored procedures, User Defined Functions, Table Valued Functionsc,
views, masking PPI, encryption, storing sensitive data,
query optimization and execution plans


I also know how to use Microsoft Report Builder and PowerBI. Which is what I used to create the graphs I made.
